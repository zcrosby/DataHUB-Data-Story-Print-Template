	<div class="frame blue">
		
		<div class="content">
		
		The use of alcohol and illicit drugs among middle and high school students, in particular marijuana, has been increasing in Rhode Island and throughout the nation. Furthermore, this increase has been accompanied by a decrease in the perceived risks of drug use, despite studies showing that drug use can lead to addiction, mood disorders, and reduced long-term cognitive function.

		This story compares student use of alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes, and other substances in Barrington public schools by grade. Substance use is examined in three different ways:
		<ul>
			<li>Age of first use</li>
			<li>Frequency of use over the last 30 days</li>
			<li>Frequency of use over the student’s lifetime</li>
		</ul>

		For frequency measures, tobacco products are reported separately to accommodate the difference in how their use is measured (for example: 10 cigarettes, half a pack/per day). 

		<b>NOTE: All figures are self-reported estimates of substance use.</b>

	<div class="frame blue">
		<div class="content">
			The Barrington Adult Youth (BAY) Team is the town of Barrington’s substance abuse task force. A recipient of a federal Drug-Free Communities Support Program (DFC) grant, the team works to reduce the use and acceptance of alcohol and other drugs among youths and the community.
				
			Every two years, the BAY Team surveys Barrington middle and high school students (approximately 2,000 students) on their alcohol and drug use. The results of these surveys are examined in this stor.

			In this story, we'll examine student reports of substance use using data from the SALT
			Survey -- and going forward, the new SurveyWorks. Those surveys are offered to every
			student in every school so participation rates are usually in the low 90s (similar to attend-
			ance rates). Conversely, both the YRBS and SAMHSA national surveys sample their stu-
			dent populations which is to say, they take a portion of the population to represent thewhole.
